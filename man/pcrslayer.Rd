\arguments{
\item{metabarlist}{a \code{\link{metabarlist}} object}

\item{replicates}{a vector corresponding to the sample names to which
pcr replicates belongs. Default is the `sample_id` column of the table `pcrs`
from the \code{\link{metabarlist}} object.}

\item{method}{a character indicating which method should be used to identify PCR outliers. Can be
\code{"centroid"} or \code{"pairwise"}. Default is \code{"centroid"}.}

\item{FUN}{a function for computing distances between replicates.
Default is Bray-Curtis distances on MOTUs relative abundance table.}

\item{thresh.method}{a character indicating which method should be used to define the filtering
threshold. Can be \code{"interesect"} or \code{"mode"}.}

\item{output_col}{a character string for the column name in table `pcrs`, in
which the result will be stored.
Default is "functional_pcr"}

\item{plot}{a boolean indicating whether dissimilarity distribution should be plotted.
Default is \code{TRUE}}

\item{wthn.btwn}{an ouput from \code{pcr_within_between}}

\item{groups}{a column name in the `pcrs`table corresponding to a factor giving the groups
for which the graphical colors are drawn.}

\item{funcpcr}{a boolean vector indicating whether PCR are functional (\code{TRUE}) or not.}
}
\value{
The \code{pcrslayer} function returns a metabarlist with a new boolean column vector of name
`output_col` in table `pcrs` indicating whether the pcr is functional (\code{TRUE}) or
        or dysfunctional (\code{FALSE})

The \code{pcr_within_between} function returns a list of dissimilarities \emph{dw} and \emph{db}.

The \code{check_pcr_thresh} and  \code{check_pcr_repl} functions returns \code{ggplot} objects.

\description{
Detecting dysfunctional PCRs, i.e. PCR replicate outliers based on PCR similarity in composition in MOTUs.
}
\details{
The \code{pcrslayer} function identifies potential non-functional PCR reactions based on their reproducibility. It compares the dissimilarities in MOTU composition within a biological sample (i.e. between PCR replicates, hereafter \emph{dw}) vs. between biological samples (hereafter \emph{db}). It relies on the assumption that PCR replicates from a same biological samples should be more similar than two different biological samples (\emph{dw} < \emph{db}). Two methods for computing \emph{dw} and \emph{db} are available.

\itemize{
\item{With method \code{"centroid"}, both \emph{dw} and \emph{db} distances are based on the samples centroid. More specifically, a centroid community of each sample is built by computing the average MOTU abundances of the sample's pcr replicates. Then \emph{dw} is defined as the distance between pcr replicates and their corresponding centroid, while \emph{db} is defined as the distances between centroids of different samples. A PCR replicate having a \emph{dw} above a given dissimilarity threshold \emph{tresh} is considered as an outlier, i.e. too distant from its associated average MOTU community (\code{method="centroid"}). If only one single PCR replicate is representative of a biological sample after this trimming, it is also considered as a dysfunctional PCR. The process is repeated iteratively to recompute the sample centroid, as well as \emph{dw} and \emph{db} until no more PCRs are excluded from the analysis.}
\item{With method \code{"pairwise"}, pairwise distances between all PCR replicates are computed and then classified into \emph{dw} or \emph{db} depending on the pair considered. A PCR replicate having a an average \emph{dw} above a given dissimilarity threshold \emph{tresh} is considered as an outlier, i.e. too distant from its associated replicates (\code{method="pairwise"}). If only one single PCR replicate is representative of a biological sample after this trimming, it is also considered as a dysfunctional PCR. In this case, no iterations are done.}
}
For both methods, the user is free to chose its own distance metric and whether distances should be computed on relative abundances or true abundances, through the argument \code{FUN}. Two methods are currently pre-encoded:
\itemize{
\item{FUN_pcrdist_bray_freq computes Bray-Curtis distances on MOTUs relative abundances}
\item{FUN_pcrdist_coa_freq computes Euclidean distances between pcrs from a Correspondance Analysis on MOTUs relative abundances}
}.

The \code{pcr_within_between} function is part of \code{pcrslayer}, and computes dissimilarities in MOTU composition within a biological sample \emph{dw} and between biological samples \emph{db} following either \code{method="centroid"} or \code{method="pairwise"}

The threshold \emph{tresh} is defined automatically with two alternative methods. Either it is the intersection of \emph{dw} and \emph{db} distributions (\code{tresh.method="interesect"}). Or it is the mode of the \emph{db} distribution (\code{tresh.method="mode"}).

Function \code{check_pcr_thresh} enables visualization of \emph{dw} and \emph{db} distributions. Function \code{check_pcr_repl} enables visualization of PCR replicate dissimilarity patterns in a NMDS ordination and distance from their average OTU community.

Function \code{check_pcr_repl} enables visualization of dissimilarity patterns across all pcrs while showing pcr replicates centroids through a Principal Coordinate Analysis (PCoA) based on Bray-Curtis dissimilarities.
