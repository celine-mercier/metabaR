MetabaR-F is an R package enabling importing, handling and postprocessing metabarcoding data that have been already processed through bioinformatic pipelines. Due to its simplicity of structure, this package can be easily coupled with others R packages commonly used in ecology (vegan, ade4, ape, picante), and provides flexible graphic systems based on ggplot2 to vizualize the data under both ecological and experimental perspectives.     

More specifically, MetabaR-F provides:

- Import functions from common bioinformatic pipelines for DNA metabarcoding data (OBITools, *XXX*)   
- Functions of data curation that are absent from the above pipelines (e.g. detecting molecular artifacts such as contaminants, dysfynctional PCRs, etc.)   
- *Blablabla*

The metabaR-F package is developed on GitHub:

https://github.com/metabaRfactory/metabaRffe
